# Lab 4 - Statistics 2

# Basics

1. Use the `rmvnorm{mvtnorm}` to draw
- 120 observations from two-dimensional normal distribution *N(c(3,0), diag(1,2))*.
-  80 observations from two-dimensional normal distribution *N(c(0,3), diag(1,2))*.
Use the `rbind` function to combine these two groups together into a single matrix with 200 rows 2 columns.
Plot this dataset with the `ggplot2` package

If you wish to learn more how to generate data from multidimensional normal distribution, read https://pbiecek.gitbooks.io/przewodnik/content/Programowanie/generatory_3.html.


2. Use `kmeans{stats}` and `pam{cluster}` functions to identify 2 clusters in the dataset generated in step 1.


# Simulations

It's time to do some experiments with number of clusters

1. Generate larger number (e.g. 5) of clusters of roughly the same size (e.g. 60, 80, 100, 120, 140). 

Visually check what will happen when fitting 3, 5, 7 clusters. Run k-means few times, are these results stable or not?

2. Use the silhouette function to calculate the average silhouette / generate silhouette plots.

3. Compare the average silhouette for different number of clusters


# Real data [this will be fun]

Read data about votings from Polish Sejm 

votings <- archivist::aread("pbiecek/Przewodnik/arepo/9175ec8b23098c4364495afde9a2cc17")

If needed you can fill missing data with some value

votes_wide[is.na(votes_wide)] <- "Not present"

Use `daisy()` function or some other method to calculate distance matrix between deputies.
Find some good (what is good?) number of clusters for these deputies and check what is the relation between deputies clubs and clusters created based on their votes.







Use ONLY if in REAL need.

```{r}
library(mvtnorm)
s1 <- rmvnorm(120, c(3,0), diag(1, 2))
s2 <- rmvnorm(80, c(0,3), diag(1, 2))
ss <- as.data.frame(rbind(s1, s2))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ss, aes(V1, V2)) +
geom_point()

g1 <- kmeans(ss, 2)
library(cluster)
g2 <- pam(ss, 2)

ss$g1 <- g1$cluster
ss$g2 <- g2$clustering

ggplot(ss, aes(V1, V2, color=g1)) +
geom_point()
ggplot(ss, aes(V1, V2, color=g2)) +
geom_point()
```
